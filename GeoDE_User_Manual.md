## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 What is GeoDE?

**GeoDE (Geodesy Database Engine)** is a comprehensive Python framework designed for automated GNSS data processing, analysis, and management. Originally developed by Demian Gomez and contributors, GeoDE provides an end-to-end solution for handling large-scale geodetic datasets with robust metadata tracking and comprehensive quality control tools.

### 1.2 Key Features

- **Multi-Software Integration**: Seamlessly integrates GAMIT/GLOBK, GPSPACE, and M-PAGES (NGS) processing engines
- **Parallel Processing**: Distributes geodetic processing jobs across multiple compute nodes
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Centralized storage and management of RINEX data, station metadata, and processing results
- **GeoDE Desktop Web Interface**: Interactive map-based visualization for monitoring station networks
- **Automated Quality Control**: Built-in detection of metadata inconsistencies and data gaps
- **Multi-Format Support**: Handles RINEX 2/3, Hatanaka compression, and some raw receiver formats

### 1.3 System Requirements

**Hardware Requirements:**
- Database Server: Minimum 8GB RAM, recommended 16GB+ for large networks
- Processing Nodes: Minimum 8GB RAM per node
- Storage: Varies by network size (estimate ~100MB per station-year for RINEX + products)

**Software Dependencies:**
- Python 3.10
- PostgreSQL 12 or higher
- GAMIT/GLOBK 10.71 or higher
- GFZRNX
- rnx2crx/crx2rnx (Hatanaka compression tools)
- GPSPACE
- GeoDE Desktop (installed from a separate repository)

---

## 2. System Architecture

### 2.1 Components Overview

GeoDE consists of two main components:

1. **GeoDE Command Line Interface (CLI)**: Core processing engine for parallel GNSS analysis
2. **GeoDE Desktop**: A web frontend for station monitoring and metadata management

### 2.2 Data Flow Architecture
GeoDE implements a robust data flow architecture designed to ensure data integrity and consistency throughout the entire processing pipeline. 
The system uses a two-stage approach: a **repository** for initial data collection and validation, followed by permanent **archival** based on verified station identity.

### Repository-Archive Concept

The **repository** serves as a staging area where all incoming RINEX data is collected and undergoes validation before permanent storage. This separation between repository and archive is critical for maintaining data quality:

- **Initial Collection**: Files downloaded from external sources are placed in the repository (`data_in`)
- **Coordinate Verification**: Each file undergoes PPP processing (or autonomous positioning as fallback) to determine the station's geographic coordinates
- **Spatial Coherence Check**: The computed coordinates are compared against the database to verify the file truly belongs to the claimed station

Only after passing the validation checks is the file moved to the permanent **archive**, where it is organized using both the station name (NetworkCode.StationCode) and its verified position. This dual verification mechanism—matching both station code and geographic location—prevents data misassignment and ensures that files claiming to be from station X are actually observed at station X's location.

> **Key Principle:** GeoDE never blindly trusts filename conventions. Every file must prove its identity through coordinate verification before entering the permanent archive. This approach catches common issues such as:
> - Incorrectly named files
> - Swapped station codes
> - Data from relocated stations
> - Files from nearby stations with similar names

## 3. Installation and Configuration

### 3.1 Database Setup

#### 3.1.1 Deploy Database Skeleton
```bash
psql -U your_username -d gnss_data < database/gnss_data_dump.sql
```

#### 3.1.2 Configure Required Tables

Import the following CSV files into your database using pgAdmin or psql:

**1. System Keys** (`keys.csv`)
```sql
COPY keys FROM '/path/to/keys.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

**2. RINEX Storage Structure** (`rinex_tank_struct.csv`)
Structure can be configured by the user. Once a structure is selected it cannot be changed.
Recommended structure:
- Level 1: KeyCode = network
- Level 2: KeyCode = year
- Level 3: KeyCode = doy
```sql
COPY rinex_tank_struct FROM '/path/to/rinex_tank_struct.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

**3. Equipment Tables**
```sql
COPY receivers FROM '/path/to/receivers.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
COPY antennas FROM '/path/to/antennas.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
COPY gamit_htc FROM '/path/to/gamit_htc.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER;
```

### 3.2 CLI Installation
```bash
pip install geode
```

**Note**: Use Python 3.10 and consider using a virtual environment.

### 3.3 Configuration File

Create `gnss_data.cfg` in your working directory:
```ini
[postgres]
hostname = your.server.fqdn
username = gnss_data_user
password = your_password
database = gnss_data
format_scripts_path = /path/to/format_scripts

[archive]
# RINEX tank location
path = /archive/path
repository = /repository/path
# Ionex files (required for GAMIT)
ionex = /orbits/ionex/$year
# Broadcast orbits
brdc = /orbits/brdc/$year
# Precise orbits
sp3 = /orbits/sp3/$gpsweek

# Compute nodes for parallel processing
node_list = node1,node2,node3,node4

# Orbit precedence (IGS convention)
sp3_ac = COD,IGS
sp3_cs = OPS,R03,MGX
sp3_st = FIN,SNX,RAP

[otl]
grdtab = /path/to/gamit/bin/grdtab
otlgrid = /path/to/gamit/tables/otl.grid
otlmodel = FES2014b

[ppp]
ppp_path = /path/to/PPP_NRCAN
ppp_exe = /path/to/PPP_NRCAN/ppp
institution = Your Institution Name
info = Your Division/Lab Name

# Reference frames
frames = IGS20,
IGS20 = 1987_1,
atx = /path/to/igs20_2335_plus.atx
```

### 3.4 Download Source Configuration

GeoDE uses a two-tier system for managing download sources:

#### 3.4.1 Database Tables

**sources_servers**: Contains server connection information
While it is possible to use Postgres (PgAdmin or psql) to insert connection information, we recommend to use GeoDE Desktop for these tasks
```sql
INSERT INTO sources_servers (protocol, fqdn, username, password, path, format)
VALUES ('ftp', 'cddis.nasa.gov', 'anonymous', 'email@domain.com',
        '/gnss/data/daily/$year/$doy/$yy{d}', 'DEFAULT_FORMAT');
```
For protocols, see [Supported Protocols](#416 Supported Protocols)

**sources_stations**: Links stations to servers with priority
```sql
INSERT INTO sources_stations ("NetworkCode", "StationCode", try_order, server_id, path, format)
VALUES ('igs', 'algo', 1, 1, NULL, NULL);
```
Fields `path` and `format` allow overriding the default fields in sources_servers for a specific station

#### 3.4.2 Format Scripts

For non-standard data formats, create processing scripts in `format_scripts_path`:

**Example: `custom_format.py`**
#@todo: add a custom format script example
```python
#!/bin/bash
# $1 = downloaded file path
# $2 = filename
# $3 = temporary directory (output location)

# Process and output RINEX files to $3
your_conversion_tool $1 -o $3/
```

## 4. Data Processing Workflow

### 4.1 Step 1: Data Download (DownloadSources.py)

#### 4.1.1 Purpose

DownloadSources.py retrieves RINEX data from external servers and places it in the repository for processing.

#### 4.1.2 Operation Overview

1. Queries database for station list and download sources
2. Creates parallel download connections to configured servers
3. Downloads RINEX files to `repository/data_in/{network}.{station}/`
4. Applies format conversion scripts if needed
5. Validates downloaded files

#### 4.1.3 Basic Usage
```bash
# Download data for specific stations
DownloadSources.py igs.algo igs.amc2

# Download for all stations in a network
DownloadSources.py igs.all

# Download data for a date range
DownloadSources.py igs.algo -date 2024/01/01 2024/01/31

# Download last N days
DownloadSources.py igs.algo -win 7

# Run without parallelization
DownloadSources.py igs.algo -win 7 -np
```

#### 4.1.4 Download Process Details

**Connection Management:**
- Maintains persistent connections to servers
- Automatically reconnects on timeout (max 8 retries)
- Refreshes connections every 2 seconds during idle
- Connection timeout: 20 seconds
- Reconnection interval: 3 seconds

**File Processing:**
- Files are first downloaded to station-specific directories
- Format scripts (if specified) process raw data
- Converted files are compressed using Hatanaka compression
- Original files are removed after successful conversion

**Source Priority:**
- Stations can have multiple sources with `try_order` priority
- If download from source N fails, attempts source N+1
- Process continues until file is found or sources exhausted

#### 4.1.5 Download Statistics

At completion, DownloadSources.py displays:
- `db_no_info`: Files skipped (no station info for date)
- `db_exists`: Files already in database
- `not_found`: Files not found in any source
- `process_ok`: Files successfully downloaded and processed
- `process_error`: Files with processing errors
- `ok`: Files downloaded without additional processing

#### 4.1.6 Supported Protocols

- **FTP**: Standard FTP connections (passive mode)
- **FTPA**: FTP active mode connections
- **SFTP**: SSH File Transfer Protocol
- **HTTP**: Standard HTTP downloads
- **HTTPS**: Secure HTTP downloads

**Special Handling:**
- NASA CDDIS: Preserves Authorization headers through redirects
- GAGE: Uses `es sso access --token` for authentication
- CSN: Implements challenge-token hash verification

### 4.2 Step 2: Data Ingestion (ArchiveService.py)

#### 4.2.1 Purpose

ArchiveService.py is the core data ingestion engine that:
1. Scans the repository for new RINEX files
2. Validates file quality and metadata
3. Runs PPP for coordinate determination
4. Manages station information locks
5. Moves files to permanent archive
6. Updates database records

#### 4.2.2 Operation Overview
```
Repository (data_in) → Scan → PPP → Validation → Archive + Database
                                ↓
                         Error Handling
                                ↓
                    data_rejected or data_in_retry
```

#### 4.2.3 Basic Usage
```bash
# Standard operation (scans repository)
ArchiveService.py

# Process visit files from field campaigns
ArchiveService.py -visits

# Purge locked files and temporary stations
ArchiveService.py -purge

# Run without parallelization
ArchiveService.py -np
```

#### 4.2.4 File Processing Pipeline

**1. Initial Scan**
- Scans `repository/data_in/` for RINEX files
- Checks against locks table to avoid reprocessing
- Validates RINEX filename format

**2. File Reading**
- Extracts station code, year, DOY from filename
- Reads RINEX header information
- Validates observation timespan

**3. PPP Coordinate Determination**

ArchiveService attempts to determine station coordinates using:

a. **Primary Method: PPP Processing**
   - Uses precise orbits and clocks
   - Applies ocean loading corrections
   - Requires valid RINEX header coordinates

b. **Fallback Method: Autonomous Positioning**
   - Uses broadcast ephemeris
   - Relaxed chi-square limit (1000)
   - Applied when PPP fails

**4. Spatial Coherence Check**

The service verifies file belongs to claimed station:
```python
Result, match, closest = verify_spatial_coherence(cnn, StationCode)
```

**Possible Outcomes:**

- **Single Match**: File matches exactly one station → Insert to database
- **Wrong Station Code**: File matches different station → Move to retry
- **Multiple Candidates**: Ambiguous match → Move to retry
- **No Match**: New station detected → Create lock and temporary network

#### 4.2.5 Temporary Networks and Locks

When a new station is detected:

1. **Temporary Network Creation**
   - Network code format: `???`, `?00`, `?01`, ..., `?ff`
   - Maximum 256 temporary networks
   - Prevents automatic processing until metadata assigned

2. **Lock Mechanism**
   - File recorded in `locks` table
   - Prevents repeated processing
   - User must:
     - Assign proper network code
     - Add station metadata
     - Remove lock

3. **Station Information**
   - Automatic coordinate calculation
   - OTL coefficients computed
   - Country code determined via reverse geocoding

**Example Lock Resolution:**
```sql
-- View locked files
SELECT * FROM locks;

-- After adding station metadata:
DELETE FROM locks WHERE filename = 'specific_file.crz';

-- Update network code:
UPDATE stations SET "NetworkCode" = 'real_net' 
WHERE "NetworkCode" = '???' AND "StationCode" = 'stn1';
```

#### 4.2.6 Error Categories and Handling

**Category 1: Bad RINEX Files** → `data_rejected/bad_rinex/YYYY/DDD/`

Files moved here when:
- Corrupted or unreadable RINEX
- Single epoch observations
- Cannot determine autonomous coordinates
- Unreasonable geodetic height (> 9000m or < -400m)

**Category 2: RINEX Issues** → `data_in_retry/rinex_issues/YYYY/DDD/`

Files moved here for temporary problems:
- Missing station information
- RINEX header issues
- Incomplete metadata

**Category 3: Coordinate Conflicts** → `data_in_retry/coord_conflicts/YYYY/DDD/`

Files moved here when:
- PPP coordinate doesn't match claimed station
- File matches nearby station with different code
- Multiple possible station matches

**Example Output:**
```
amc20010.24d matches coordinate of igs.amc2 (distance = 3.421 m) 
but filename indicates it is amc0. Verify file belongs to igs.amc2,
rename and try again.

Rename script:
  mv data_in_retry/coord_conflicts/2024/001/amc20010.24d \
     data_in_retry/coord_conflicts/2024/001/amc22410.24d
     
SQL insert if new station:
  INSERT INTO stations ("NetworkCode", "StationCode", 
      "auto_x", "auto_y", "auto_z", "lat", "lon", "height") 
  VALUES ('???','amc0', 4075123.456, -4596234.567, 1234567.890,
          -45.123456, 170.234567, 234.567);
```

**Category 4: No PPP Solution** → `data_rejected/no_ppp_solution/YYYY/DDD/`

Files moved here when:
- Both PPP and autonomous positioning fail
- Missing or corrupted orbit files
- Insufficient observation data quality

**Category 5: Multiday Files** → `data_in_retry/multidays_found/YYYY/DDD/`

When a RINEX file contains multiple days:
- File is split into individual daily files
- Each day file moved to retry folder
- Original file deleted
- Event logged for tracking

**Category 6: Wrong Date** → `data_in_retry/wrong_date_found/YYYY/DDD/`

Files moved here when:
- Archive folder date ≠ RINEX observation date
- Allows ArchiveService to reprocess with correct date

**Category 7: Station Information Problems** → `data_in_retry/station_info_exception/YYYY/DDD/`

Files moved here when:
- No valid station information record for observation date
- Antenna/receiver metadata conflicts
- Height code issues

**Category 8: OTL Calculation Errors** → `data_in_retry/otl_exception/YYYY/DDD/`

Files moved here when:
- Ocean loading coefficient calculation fails
- Invalid station coordinates for OTL
- GAMIT grdtab execution errors

**Category 9: Orbit Product Issues** → `data_in_retry/sp3_exception/YYYY/DDD/`

Files moved here when:
- Cannot download/find required orbit files
- Corrupted SP3 or clock files
- Broadcast ephemeris unavailable

**Category 10: Duplicate Insertions** → `data_rejected/duplicate_insert/YYYY/DDD/`

Files moved here when:
- File with same interval and completion exists
- Database constraint violation
- Prevents duplicate data

#### 4.2.7 Visit File Processing

Field campaign data can be automatically processed:
```bash
ArchiveService.py -visits
```

**Process:**
1. Queries `api_visitgnssdatafiles` table
2. Converts proprietary formats to RINEX
3. Merges RINEX files from same day/interval
4. Moves to `data_in/` for standard processing

**Supported Formats:**
- Configured in `ConvertRaw.py`
- Custom format handlers can be added
- Automatic file type detection

#### 4.2.8 Event Logging

All ArchiveService operations are logged to `events` table:

**Event Types:**
- `info`: Successful operations
- `warn`: Warnings (e.g., multiday files, duplicates)
- `error`: Processing failures

**View Recent Events:**
Events can be viewes using a SQL command or through GeoDE Desktop. We recommend the latter, where events for each station can be found in the events section of the web interface.
```sql
SELECT * FROM events 
WHERE "EventDate" >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
ORDER BY "EventDate" DESC;
```

#### 4.2.9 Performance Considerations

**Parallelization:**
- Distributes files across configured nodes
- Each node processes independently
- Database transactions ensure consistency

**Batch Processing:**
- Progress bars show real-time status
- Errors logged without stopping batch
- Summary statistics at completion

**Resource Management:**
- Temporary files cleaned automatically
- Failed jobs don't block queue
- Automatic retry on transient failures

### 4.3 Step 3: PPP Solutions (ScanArchive.py)

#### 4.3.1 Purpose

ScanArchive.py provides comprehensive archive management:
1. Scan archive for RINEX files and add to database
2. Calculate Ocean Loading coefficients
3. Insert/update station information
4. Run PPP on archived RINEX files
5. Export/import stations between systems
6. Verify data integrity

#### 4.3.2 Basic Operations

#@todo: need to change to new OTL program
**Calculate OTL Coefficients:**
```bash
# Calculate for stations without OTL
ScanArchive.py igs.algo igs.amc2 -otl
```

**Insert Station Information:**
```bash
# Scan archive for station.info files
ScanArchive.py igs.all -stninfo

# Insert from specific file
ScanArchive.py igs.algo -stninfo /path/to/station.info igs

# Read from standard input
cat station.info | ScanArchive.py igs.algo -stninfo stdin igs
```

**Run PPP Processing:**
#@todo: explain what hash is
```bash
# Process all RINEX without PPP solutions
ScanArchive.py igs.algo -ppp

# Process specific date range
ScanArchive.py igs.algo -ppp 2024/01/01 2024/01/31

# Check and recalculate if hash mismatch
ScanArchive.py igs.algo -ppp 2024/01/01 2024/01/31 hash
```

**Hash Management:**
```bash
# Rehash without recalculating PPP
ScanArchive.py igs.algo -rehash 2024/01/01 2024/01/31
```

#### 4.3.3 PPP Processing Details

**Hash Verification System:**

GeoDE uses CRC32 hashes to track station information changes:
```python
hash = station_info_hash + crc32(orbit_filename)
```

**When hash mismatch detected:**
- PPP solution marked for recalculation
- Ensures solutions reflect current metadata
- Tracks orbit file used for solution

**PPP Execution Process:**

1. **Load Station Information**
   - Query metadata for observation date
   - Apply height tolerance if specified
   - Validate antenna/receiver records

2. **RINEX Header Normalization**
   - Update approximate coordinates
   - Apply antenna offsets
   - Correct receiver/antenna codes

3. **PPP Processing**
   - Apply ocean loading corrections
   - Use precise orbits/clocks
   - Apply meteorological data if available
   - Clock interpolation enabled

4. **Spatial Coherence Verification**
   - Verify solution matches station location
   - Check against database coordinates
   - Flag suspicious coordinates

5. **Database Update**
   - Insert PPP solution record
   - Create event log entry
   - Update station statistics

**Multiday File Handling:**

If RINEX spans multiple days:
1. Split into separate daily files
2. Move to `data_in_retry/multidays_found/`
3. Delete original multiday file
4. Remove database record
5. Files will be reprocessed individually

**Station Information Tolerance:**
#@todo: check -tol switch
```bash
# Allow 2-hour gaps in station information
ScanArchive.py igs.algo -ppp -tol 2
```

Useful for:
- Early survey campaigns
- Stations with incomplete metadata
- Temporary equipment changes

#### 4.3.4 Export/Import Operations

**Export Station:**
```bash
# Full export with RINEX data
ScanArchive.py igs.algo -export

# Dataless export (metadata only)
ScanArchive.py igs.algo -export true
```

**Export Contents:**
- Station information records
- Coordinates and OTL coefficients
- RINEX file list
- RINEX data (unless dataless)

**Import Station:**
```bash
# Import with default network assignment
ScanArchive.py dummy -import ars station1.zip station2.zip

# Import with wildcards
ScanArchive.py dummy -import ars *.zip
```

**Import Process:**
1. Extract ZIP contents
2. Read JSON metadata
3. Perform spatial coherence check
4. Present options to user:
   - Insert as new station
   - Merge with existing station
   - Skip import

**Interactive Prompts:**
```
Found external station igs.algo in network igs (distance 0.123 m)
Insert data to this station?: y/n

External station igs.algo not found. 
Possible match is igs.algo: 45.234 m
(i)nsert new/(a)dd to existing station?: i/a

Multiple matches found:
  net1.algo (1)
  net2.algo (2)
(i)nsert new/(number): 1
```

#### 4.3.5 Extract RINEX from Archive
```bash
# Get specific station-day
ScanArchive.py igs.algo -get 2024/01/15
```

**Process:**
1. Locates RINEX in archive
2. Normalizes header with station information
3. Compresses and copies to current directory
4. Applies proper naming conventions

#### 4.3.6 Event Summary

At completion, ScanArchive.py displays:
```
Summary of events for this run:
-- info    : 45
-- errors  : 2
-- warnings: 7
```

**Event categories tracked:**
- Successful operations
- File rejections
- Metadata updates
- Processing errors

### 4.4 Step 4: Integrity Checking (IntegrityCheck.py)

#### 4.4.1 Purpose

IntegrityCheck.py provides comprehensive validation tools:
1. Verify RINEX file existence in archive
2. Check station information consistency
3. Validate spatial coherence of PPP solutions
4. Detect data gaps
5. Manage station merges and renames
6. Exclude or delete problematic solutions

#### 4.4.2 RINEX Integrity Checks

**Report Mode:**
```bash
# Check files exist in archive
IntegrityCheck.py igs.algo -rinex report -d 2024/01/01 2024/12/31
```

**Fix Mode:**
```bash
# Remove database records for missing files
IntegrityCheck.py igs.algo -rinex fix -d 2024/01/01 2024/12/31
```

**What it does:**
- Verifies each database record has corresponding archive file
- Reports missing files
- In fix mode: removes orphaned database records
- Deletes associated PPP/GAMIT solutions
- Logs events for tracking

#### 4.4.3 Station Information Checks

**Consistency Check:**
```bash
IntegrityCheck.py igs.algo -stnc
```

**Validates:**
1. **Session End Records**
   - Only one record should have DateEnd = 9999 999
   - Reports multiple open-ended records

2. **Overlapping Records**
   - Detects conflicting date ranges
   - Identifies ambiguous metadata periods

3. **RINEX Coverage**

```

**Graphical Visualization:**
```bash
IntegrityCheck.py igs.algo -gg -d 2024/01/01 2024/12/31
```

**Visual Output:**
```
igs.algo: (First and last observation: 2024 001 - 2024 365)

2024:
    001>████████████████████ ███ ████████████<120
    121>██████████ ████████████████████████<240
    241>████████████████████████████<365

Legend: █ = data present,   = data missing
        Each character = 2 days
```

**Count RINEX Files:**
```bash
IntegrityCheck.py igs.all -rnx_count -d 2024/01/01 2024/12/31
```

**Output:**
```
 2024   1   45
 2024   2   47
 2024   3   46
 ...
```
Format: Year DOY Count

#### 4.4.6 Station Information Operations

**Print Station Information:**
```bash
# Short format (screen-friendly)
IntegrityCheck.py igs.algo -print short

# Long format (full station.info)
IntegrityCheck.py igs.algo -print long
```

**Propose Station Information:**
```bash
# Generate station.info from RINEX headers
IntegrityCheck.py igs.algo -stnp

# Ignore records <= 7 days
IntegrityCheck.py igs.algo -stnp 7
```

**Uses:**
- Quick metadata generation for new stations
- Verify RINEX header consistency
- Identify equipment changes

#### 4.4.7 Station Rename/Merge

**Use Case:** Merge two stations or rename a station
```bash
# Rename igs.old_code to igs.new_code
# Date range limits which files are moved
IntegrityCheck.py igs.old_code -r igs.new_code \
    -d 2024/01/01 2024/12/31 -del_stn
```

**Process:**
1. Verifies destination station exists
2. Transfers RINEX files (renames in archive)
3. Updates database records (NetworkCode, StationCode, Filename)
4. Handles duplicate files (reports, removes from source)
5. Merges station information as needed
6. Optionally deletes empty source station

**RINEX Filename Handling:**
- Properly handles RINEX 2 and RINEX 3 formats
- Updates station code in filename
- Preserves compression type
- Maintains archive structure

**Station Information Merge:**
- Checks if destination has metadata for date range
- Copies source station info if missing in destination
- Warns about incomplete metadata transfers
- Adjusts DateStart/DateEnd if needed

**Deletion Criteria:**
- Only deletes if `-del_stn` flag used
- Only if source station completely empty
- Backs up station information in events table
- Removes from all related tables

**Example Output:**
```
Beginning transfer of 365 rinex files from igs.old_code to igs.new_code
Station will be deleted at the end of the process if no further RINEX files are found.

Processing: 100%|████████████| 365/365

igs.old_code.2024001.crz successfully moved to igs.new_code
igs.old_code.2024002.crz could not be moved (already exists in destination)
...

Station successfully deleted after rename/merge process.
```

#### 4.4.8 Solution Management

**Exclude Solutions:**
```bash
# Add solutions to exclusion table
IntegrityCheck.py igs.algo -es 2024/01/01 2024/01/31
```

**Uses:**
- Temporarily remove bad solutions from processing
- Preserve data while investigating issues
- Solutions remain in database but marked excluded

**Delete RINEX and Solutions:**
```bash
# Delete files with completion <= 0.3
IntegrityCheck.py igs.algo -del 2024/01/01 2024/01/31 0.3
```

**WARNING:** This operation cannot be undone!

**Deletes:**
- RINEX files from archive
- Database records (rinex table)
- PPP solutions
- GAMIT solutions
- All associated data

**Use Cases:**
- Remove low-quality data (< 12 hours)
- Clean up test data
- Free archive space

#### 4.4.9 Best Practices for Integrity Checking

**Regular Checks:**
```bash
# Weekly integrity check script
#!/bin/bash

# Check RINEX file existence
IntegrityCheck.py all -rinex report -d $(date -d '7 days ago' +%Y/%m/%d) $(date +%Y/%m/%d)

# Verify station information consistency
IntegrityCheck.py all -stnc

# Check spatial coherence of recent solutions
IntegrityCheck.py all -sc noop -d $(date -d '7 days ago' +%Y/%m/%d) $(date +%Y/%m/%d)
```

**After Metadata Updates:**
```bash
# Verify changes don't create conflicts
IntegrityCheck.py network.station -stnc

# Check hash values
ScanArchive.py network.station -ppp $(date +%Y/%m/%d) $(date +%Y/%m/%d) hash
```

**Before Major Operations:**
```bash
# Verify data integrity before station merge
IntegrityCheck.py source.station -rinex report
IntegrityCheck.py dest.station -rinex report
IntegrityCheck.py source.station -stnc
IntegrityCheck.py dest.station -stnc
```

**"Could not determine coordinate"**
```
Error: Both PPP and sh_rx2apr failed to obtain a coordinate
```

**Causes:**
- Missing or corrupted broadcast ephemeris
- Insufficient observation data
- Invalid RINEX header coordinates

**Solutions:**
1. Check orbit file availability:
```bash
   ls /orbits/brdc/2024/brdc0010.24n
```
2. Verify RINEX has valid header coordinates
3. Manually add approximate coordinates to header

**"Unreasonable geodetic height"**
```
Error: unreasonable geodetic height (15234.567)
```

**Causes:**
- Bad PPP solution
- Corrupted RINEX data
- Wrong station location in header

**Solutions:**
1. Check RINEX header coordinates
2. Verify station is not in excluded list
3. Re-download RINEX file

**"Station matches different coordinate"**
```
Warning: amc20010.24d matches igs.amc2 (distance = 3.4 m) 
but filename indicates amc0
```

**Causes:**
- Wrong station code in filename
- File belongs to different station
- Nearby stations with similar codes

**Solutions:**
1. Verify which station file truly belongs to
2. Rename file:
```bash
   cd data_in_retry/coord_conflicts/2024/001/
   mv amc00010.24d amc20010.24d
```
3. Or create new station if legitimate:
```sql
   INSERT INTO stations ("NetworkCode", "StationCode", 
       "auto_x", "auto_y", "auto_z") 
   VALUES ('???', 'amc0', x, y, z);
```

**"Multiday RINEX file"**
```
Warning: algo0010.24d was a multi-day rinex file
```

**Causes:**
- RINEX spans multiple days
- Incorrect session duration

**Solutions:**
- Files automatically split and moved to retry folder
- Wait for next ArchiveService run to process
- If recurring, check data source settings

random_page_cost = 1.1
effective_io_concurrency = 200
work_mem = 20MB
min_wal_size = 1GB
max_wal_size = 4GB
```
Query optimization:
```sql-- Analyze query plan
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT * FROM rinex_proc
WHERE "NetworkCode" = 'igs' AND "ObservationYear" = 2024;

-- Create useful indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_rinex_network_year ON rinex("NetworkCode", "ObservationYear");
CREATE INDEX idx_ppp_station_year ON ppp_soln("NetworkCode", "StationCode", "Year");
CREATE INDEX idx_events_date_type ON events("EventDate", "EventType");
```
8.3.5 Data Archival
Archive old events:
sql-- Create archive table
CREATE TABLE events_archive (LIKE events INCLUDING ALL);

-- Move old events
INSERT INTO events_archive
SELECT * FROM events
WHERE "EventDate" < '2022-01-01';

DELETE FROM events
WHERE "EventDate" < '2022-01-01';

-- Vacuum to reclaim space
VACUUM FULL events;
Partition large tables:
sql-- Create partitioned table

9. Best Practices
9.1 Data Processing Workflow
9.1.1 Daily Operations
Recommended daily script:
```bash#!/bin/bash
# Daily GeoDE processing script

LOG_DIR="/var/log/geode"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)

# 1. Download new data
echo "$(date): Starting downloads" >> $LOG_DIR/daily_$DATE.log
DownloadSources.py all -win 3 2>&1 | tee -a $LOG_DIR/download_$DATE.log

# 2. Process repository
echo "$(date): Processing repository" >> $LOG_DIR/daily_$DATE.log
ArchiveService.py 2>&1 | tee -a $LOG_DIR/archive_$DATE.log

# 3. Run PPP on new files
echo "$(date): Running PPP" >> $LOG_DIR/daily_$DATE.log
ScanArchive.py all -ppp $(date -d '3 days ago' +%Y/%m/%d) $(date +%Y/%m/%d) \
    2>&1 | tee -a $LOG_DIR/ppp_$DATE.log

# 4. Check for errors
ERROR_COUNT=$(grep -c "EventType.*error" $LOG_DIR/*_$DATE.log)
if [ $ERROR_COUNT -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "$(date): $ERROR_COUNT errors detected" | mail -s "GeoDE Errors" admin@example.com
fi

echo "$(date): Daily processing complete" >> $LOG_DIR/daily_$DATE.log
```
9.1.2 Weekly Maintenance
Weekly integrity checks:
```bash#!/bin/bash
# Weekly integrity check script

WEEK_AGO=$(date -d '7 days ago' +%Y/%m/%d)
TODAY=$(date +%Y/%m/%d)

# Check RINEX file existence
IntegrityCheck.py all -rinex report -d $WEEK_AGO $TODAY > weekly_rinex_check.txt

# Verify station information
IntegrityCheck.py all -stnc > weekly_stninfo_check.txt

# Check spatial coherence
IntegrityCheck.py all -sc noop -d $WEEK_AGO $TODAY > weekly_spatial_check.txt

# Email results
if [ -s weekly_rinex_check.txt ] || \
   [ -s weekly_stninfo_check.txt ] || \
   [ -s weekly_spatial_check.txt ]; then
    cat weekly_*.txt | mail -s "Weekly GeoDE Integrity Report" admin@example.com
fi
```
9.1.3 Monthly Tasks
Monthly activities:

Review and clean retry folders
Archive old event logs
Update equipment tables (new receivers/antennas)
Verify backup integrity
Review processing statistics
Update documentation

Monthly cleanup script:
```bash#!/bin/bash
# Monthly cleanup

# Archive events older than 1 year
psql -d gnss_data -c "
    INSERT INTO events_archive 
    SELECT * FROM events 
    WHERE \"EventDate\" < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';
    
    DELETE FROM events 
    WHERE \"EventDate\" < NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year';
"

# Clean old retry files (> 90 days)
find /repository/data_in_retry -type f -mtime +90 -delete
find /repository/data_rejected -type f -mtime +90 -delete

# Vacuum database
psql -d gnss_data -c "VACUUM ANALYZE;"

# Generate monthly statistics
psql -d gnss_data -c "
    SELECT 
        DATE_TRUNC('month', \"EventDate\") as month,
        \"EventType\",
        COUNT(*) as count
    FROM events
    WHERE \"EventDate\" >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 month'
    GROUP BY month, \"EventType\"
    ORDER BY month, \"EventType\";
" > monthly_stats_$(date +%Y%m).txt
```
9.2 Station Management
9.2.1 Adding New Stations

**We recommend using GeoDE Desktop for the following operations, but SQL commands can also be used.**

Procedure:

Create network (if new):

```sql   INSERT INTO networks ("NetworkCode", "NetworkName")
   VALUES ('ars', 'My Network Name');
```
Add station record:

```sql   INSERT INTO stations ("NetworkCode", "StationCode")
   VALUES ('ars', 'stn1');
```
Configure download sources:

```sql   INSERT INTO sources_stations 
   ("NetworkCode", "StationCode", try_order, server_id)
   VALUES ('ars', 'stn1', 1, 1);
```
Download initial data:

```bash   DownloadSources.py ars.stn1 -date 2024/01/01 2024/12/31
```

Process repository:

```bash   ArchiveService.py
```

Add station information via web interface
Calculate OTL:
```
bash   ScanArchive.py ars.stn1 -otl
```

Run initial PPP:
```
bash   ScanArchive.py ars.stn1 -ppp
```
9.2.2 Decommissioning Stations
Procedure:

Update station status in web interface
Stop downloads (optional):

```sql   DELETE FROM sources_stations 
   WHERE "NetworkCode" = 'net' AND "StationCode" = 'stn';
```
Document decommission in events:

```sql   INSERT INTO events ("NetworkCode", "StationCode", "EventType", "Description")
   VALUES ('net', 'stn', 'info', 'Station decommissioned on 2024-12-31');
```

DO NOT delete station record (preserves historical data)

9.2.3 Station Merges
When to merge:

Station code changed
Station relocated within 100m
Network reorganization
Duplicate stations discovered

Merge procedure:

```bash# 1. Verify stations exist
IntegrityCheck.py old.stn -print short
IntegrityCheck.py new.stn -print short

# 2. Check for conflicts
IntegrityCheck.py old.stn -stnc
IntegrityCheck.py new.stn -stnc

# 3. Backup data
pg_dump -t station_info -t rinex -t ppp_soln \
    --where="\"NetworkCode\"='old' AND \"StationCode\"='stn'" \
    > backup_old_stn.sql

# 4. Perform merge
IntegrityCheck.py old.stn -r new.stn -d 2020/01/01 2024/12/31 -del_stn

# 5. Verify merge
IntegrityCheck.py new.stn -rinex report
IntegrityCheck.py new.stn -stnc
```

9.3 Quality Control
9.3.1 Automated QC Checks
Daily QC script:
```
bash#!/bin/bash
# Automated quality control

QC_DIR="/var/log/geode/qc"
DATE=$(date +%Y%m%d)

# Check for spatial outliers
IntegrityCheck.py all -sc noop -d $(date -d '1 day ago' +%Y/%m/%d) $(date +%Y/%m/%d) \
    > $QC_DIR/spatial_$DATE.txt

# Identify low-completion files
psql -d gnss_data -t -c "
    SELECT \"NetworkCode\" || '.' || \"StationCode\", 
           \"ObservationYear\", \"ObservationDOY\", \"Completion\"
    FROM rinex
    WHERE \"Completion\" < 0.7 
      AND \"ObservationSTime\" >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
" > $QC_DIR/lowcomp_$DATE.txt

# Check for missing PPP
psql -d gnss_data -t -c "
    SELECT r.\"NetworkCode\" || '.' || r.\"StationCode\",
           r.\"ObservationYear\", r.\"ObservationDOY\"
    FROM rinex r
    LEFT JOIN ppp_soln p ON 
        r.\"NetworkCode\" = p.\"NetworkCode\" AND
        r.\"StationCode\" = p.\"StationCode\" AND
        r.\"ObservationYear\" = p.\"Year\" AND
        r.\"ObservationDOY\" = p.\"DOY\"
    WHERE p.\"NetworkCode\" IS NULL
      AND r.\"Completion\" >= 0.5
      AND r.\"ObservationSTime\" >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 day'
" > $QC_DIR/missing_ppp_$DATE.txt

# Email if issues found
if [ -s $QC_DIR/spatial_$DATE.txt ] || \
   [ -s $QC_DIR/lowcomp_$DATE.txt ] || \
   [ -s $QC_DIR/missing_ppp_$DATE.txt ]; then
    {
        echo "Quality Control Report - $DATE"
        echo "================================"
        echo ""
        echo "Spatial Outliers:"
        cat $QC_DIR/spatial_$DATE.txt
        echo ""
        echo "Low Completion Files:"
        cat $QC_DIR/lowcomp_$DATE.txt
        echo ""
        echo "Missing PPP Solutions:"
        cat $QC_DIR/missing_ppp_$DATE.txt
    } | mail -s "GeoDE QC Report $DATE" qc@example.com
fi
```
9.3.2 Manual QC Procedures
Monthly QC checklist:

 Review error logs
 Check station information completeness
 Verify coordinate time series for outliers
 Inspect data gap patterns
 Review hash mismatch cases
 Validate new equipment entries
 Check download source availability
 Verify backup completion

QC report generation:
```
bash# Generate comprehensive QC report
{
    echo "=== GeoDE Quality Control Report ==="
    echo "Generated: $(date)"
    echo ""
    
    echo "=== Database Statistics ==="

        FROM rinex
        WHERE \"ObservationSTime\" >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days'
        GROUP BY DATE(\"ObservationSTime\")
        ORDER BY date DESC
        LIMIT 30;
    "
    
} > qc_report_$(date +%Y%m).txt
```
9.4 Performance Optimization
9.4.1 Processing Speed
Parallel processing configuration:
```
ini# gnss_data.cfg - Optimize for your cluster
```

# More nodes = faster processing
node_list = node1,node2,node3,node4,node5,node6

# Ensure network connectivity
# ping node1
# ssh node1 hostname
Database connection pooling:

```python# For high-frequency operations, use connection pooling
# Add to Python scripts:
from geode import dbConnection

# Reuse connections
cnn = dbConnection.Cnn("gnss_data.cfg")
# ... perform operations ...
# Don't close until all operations complete
cnn.close()
```
Disk I/O optimization:

```bash# Use SSD for database
# /var/lib/postgresql on SSD

# Use spinning disk for archive
# /archive on RAID array

# Separate repository from archive
# /repository on fast local disk
```
9.4.2 Resource Management
Monitor system resources:
```bash# Check CPU usage
top -b -n 1 | head -20

# Check memory
free -h

# Check disk I/O
iostat -x 2 5

# Check network
iftop -i eth0
```
Limit parallel jobs:
```bash# For systems with limited resources
DownloadSources.py all -win 7 -np  # Sequential downloads
ArchiveService.py -np              # Sequential processing
ScanArchive.py all -ppp -np        # Sequential PPP
```
Database query optimization:
```sql-- Add indexes for common queries
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_rinex_completion 
    ON rinex("Completion") WHERE "Completion" >= 0.5;

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_rinex_obstime 
    ON rinex("ObservationSTime");

CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_events_recent 
    ON events("EventDate") WHERE "EventDate" >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30 days';

-- Analyze tables regularly
ANALYZE rinex;
ANALYZE ppp_soln;
ANALYZE events;
```
9.4.3 Archive Management
Archive growth estimation:
```bash# Estimate archive size
du -sh /archive

# Size per network
du -sh /archive/*

# Largest stations
du -sh /archive/*/*/ | sort -h | tail -20
```
